def parse_location_input(location_input: str | tuple | None) -> str | None:

    Handles text search input for --peo_in or --inc_in.

    This function processes the input to ensure it is in an acceptable format 
    for location searches. It supports single or multiple locations provided 
    as a string or a tuple. If the input is a tuple, it converts the tuple to 
    a comma-separated string. It also removes any whitespace from the output 
    string to prevent errors during further processing.

    Parameters:
    location_input (str | tuple | None): The input location(s) to be parsed. 
        It can be a single location as a string, multiple locations as a tuple 
        of strings, or None.

    Returns:
    str: A string representation of the location(s) with no whitespace.

    Raises:
    ValueError: If the input is not a string, tuple, or None, or if any location 
        in the input is not in the TEXT_SEARCH_LOCATIONS_MAPPING.
